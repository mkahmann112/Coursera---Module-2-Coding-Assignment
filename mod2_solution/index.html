  		<p class="sectiontitle"><span>History</span></p>
  		<p class="sectiontext">In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.</p>
